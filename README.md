### Youtube volume adjuster extension.

This is a simple extension that uses the `Web Audio Api` to amplify volume. The script is very simple and the UI is very basic. The extension is not published on the Chrome Web Store, so you will have to load it as an unpacked extension. I wanted to play around with the `Web Audio Api` and this is what I came up with.

### How to use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable developer mode.
4. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder where you cloned the repository.
5. Go to Youtube and play a video.
6. Click on the extension icon and adjust the volume.

### Note:
The extension will mainly work on youtube plus any other website that uses the `video` and `audio` tag. The extension will not work on websites that use `iframe` to embed videos.
